USE:
The game comes with a tutorial to explain mechanics and units. All modules must be installed within the venv folder, including the art folder, to work.


ADDITIONAL NOTE:
In game, the text size of the display window on the right side can vary, and depending on specs may overlap the border. The solution to this is to reduce the text size. Text should be mostly visible regardless.
